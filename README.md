# Predict 2D acoustic field in circular domain using PINNs
This repository provides an efficient, customizable approach to predict the two-dimensional acoustic field in a circular domain in the MATLAB environment using L-BFGS optimizer. The theory associated with the code is available in the article https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2025.119022.

In this repository, the code associated with the prediction of acoustic field in 2-D circular domains, which is ideal for researchers, students, and practitioners in acoustics, computational physics and scientific machine learning, is provided.

Comments are available at the respective sections inside the code and are self-explanatory.
